develop for As we discussed in Octoberhttpscertifiedfresheventscomeventsgoingserverless the trend towards serverless architectures is changing the way developers build their apps It solves a number of problems but also brings new complexities Brian LeRoux will discuss how one tool is aiming to address the complexities it can bring Complex conversational bots are also changing the ways in which businesses interact with their customers Many common tasks once handled via the phone or chat with a live person can now be handled by an automated bot Andy Barnov will teach you how you can build a conversational bot using Ruby Going Severless on Easy Mode With functions as a service cloud providers have signaled the smallest billable unit of computation is a single function execution Its a beautifully simple idea rejecting the metaphor of a server and freeing developers to design smaller and simpler services We can iterate on our code with a high degree of isolation without fear of affecting other parts of the system deploy systems in seconds with zero downtime and always be available regardless of load However building serverlessy apps is very new and as such fought with early days complexity Configuration tooling was designed for the last generation of computing metaphors and often lags behind the releases of new functionality AWS is massive and overwhelming with many similar but not the same products The web console is confusing with divergent interfaces between interlocking services Deep proprietary knowledge is required to configure and maintain common infrastructure primitives In this talk Brian will walk you through a new approach to architecting applications with plain text using arccodeshttpsarccodes to create apps in minutes and subsequently deploy in seconds with zero downtime and unprecedented availability Brian LeRoux Brian LeRoux is the CofounderCTO of begincomhttpsbegincom which is a new breed of app that helps teams stay organized

everywhere which naturally makes developers skeptical that it is a marketing buzzword However behind the term is a useful concept of tools and architecture that takes the need to worry about servers

JavaScript OMG Serverless is the new buzzword which is what we needed another buzzword Serverless refers to new technologies that let us as developers reframe the way we think about building applications when we dont have to think about the server part Serverless doesnt mean no server it just means you dont have to worry about that piece of your application anymore and well take a look at

hardest parts of the job comes after the initial code is written when it is time to refine tune and test the application It can take a deep understanding of the languages tools and code to maximize the applications performance and experience In this session well take a deeper look at some ways that you can improve your application development from a deep dive into CSS internals to more general trends and performance issues that can impact your applications user experience The Hunt for the Unicorn Performance Metric Slow websites suck We know that intuitively But how do we define slow And how do we define suck These are ephemeral words yet as developers designers UX pros and performance engineers were tasked with quantifying them and then moving on to the next step of figuring out how fast is fast enough for our users The key to a good user experience is quickly delivering the content your visitors care about the most This is easy to say but tricky to do Every site has unique content and unique user engagement goals which is why measuring how quickly critical content renders is a hugely challenging task In the past we relied on metrics like page load time start render and time to first paint to measure user experience but we now know that these metrics dont tell the full story Theres a lot of competition to define the next big unicorn performance metric but does this unicorn actually exist In this talk Tammy will walk you through a brief history of UX and web performance research Shell highlight key studies that connect the dots between performance and user experience Shell also demystify the current state of performance metrics and help you understand what you need to focus on for your site and your users Tammy Everts Tammy Everts is chief experience

was in its infancy two decades ago things were drastically different Sites had hit counters used frames for navigation and were updated manually via FTP We used the blink tag and scrolling marquees
