      <title>Sextech: The Good, the Bad &amp; the Bias</title>
      <link>https://cfe.dev/events/networking-for-developers/</link>

      <description>How to Get Through the Awkwardness of Networking There&amp;rsquo;s a lot about modern networking that we all should un-learn. Showing off your knowledge and targeting the &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo; connections is the wrong approach. If you genuinely want to be an effective networker, you have to shift away from looking at these interactions as transactional. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s still hard to find people to talk to, and even harder to know to start up a conversation.</description>

      <description>This month we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at an area where a lot of technology innovation is occurring, but where we often don&amp;rsquo;t hear about due to some misconceptions and biases around a sensitive topic - sextech. Join us to learn more about what this area of technology is about much more than what you may imagine.
Sextech: The Good, the Bad &amp;amp; the Bias When it comes to sextech, people often let their imaginations get in the way of the facts.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a ton of buzz in the .NET community lately around Blazor. Unlike many hyped technologies however, Blazor seems to have earned the attention. It earned it in part by delivering a solution that gives C# developers what they want but doing so in a way that relied on open web standards. In this session, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Jeremy Likness will go deeper into what Blazor is, how it works and how you can use it to build web apps.</description>

      <guid>https://cfe.dev/events/developer-relations/</guid>
      <description>Developer Relations and developer advocates have gone from being that rare &amp;ldquo;nice to have&amp;rdquo; that only a handful of companies could afford, to a requirement for most companies that need to connect with developers as consumers of their products and services. Nonetheless, it is still an often misunderstood practice - seen as someone who simply jets around from one conference party to another. In this session, Mary Thengvall will discuss what developer relations is and why it matters to developers.</description>

      <description>In virtual reality, we replace the user&amp;rsquo;s physical world with another entirely. This has important use cases. However, augmented reality and mixed reality applications build upon the user&amp;rsquo;s real-world environment to create a hybrid reality where real world objects and virtual objects coexist. This opens up a whole new set of application possibilities where the user can still interact with their surroundings, but enhanced with information.
In this session, AyÅŸegÃ¼l YÃ¶net will explore VR, AR and Mixed Reality.</description>

      <description>Building a checkout process is almost a right of passage for a web developer, but, unfortunately, it has often been difficult and complicated to do. Part of the problem was that, even though this was a common requirement, there was no standard way to implement payments on the web. The good news is, that is changing. In this session, Robert Wozniak, Invited Expert at the W3C, will discuss new APIs that will help standardize the way we handle payments in the browser.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re chatting with bots using text or voice. Or we&amp;rsquo;re interacting with all sorts of internet connected devices that, in many cases don&amp;rsquo;t even have a screen. In this free online meetup, Tomomi Imura of Slack and David Simmons of InfluxData will discuss some these important topics around chat bots, IoT and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>Developers today have the blessing and the curse of a plethora of tools. On the one hand, we have pretty much all of our bases covered - often for free. On the other, it can be tough to keep pace with all the tools and what they are good for.
In this month&amp;rsquo;s meetup, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore a couple of these tools and get to know them. First, Chris Coyier will go through CodePen and how to take advantage of this social development environment for front-end designers and developers.</description>

New tools, services and serverless functions are redefining the way we build &amp;ldquo;static sites&amp;rdquo; to the point that they needed a new name that represented their real capabilities: JAMStack.
In this session, Raymond Camden of Auth0 and Phil Hawksworth of Netlify will show how to get started with the JAMStack and how you can take advantage of all of these tools to build sites that are dynamic, secure and incredibly fast.</description>

      <description>Of all the new technologies impacting developers today, machine learning has been probably the most immediately impactful. Already it is changing the way we use data to do things like predict how customers will behave or when machines may need repair. It is not an exaggeration to say that developers who understand how to leverage machine learning will become indispensable to companies in the near future.
In this free event, Paige Bailey of Microsoft and Nick Walsh of Datmo will explain the basics of machine learning and artificial intelligence - what it is and why we should care - and even walk through how to build an application based upon machine learning.</description>

      <description>Most experienced developers will tell you that hardest parts of the job comes after the initial code is written - when it is time to refine, tune and test the application. It can take a deep understanding of the languages, tools and code to maximize the applications performance and experience.
In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a deeper look at some ways that you can improve your application development - from a deep dive into CSS internals to more general trends and performance issues that can impact your applications user experience.</description>

And we thought things got complex when we were just targeting desktop and mobile devices! In this free, online event we&amp;rsquo;ll cover two of those trends that are shaping how we develop and what we develop for.
As we discussed in October, the trend towards serverless architectures is changing the way developers build their apps.</description>

But how we choose to handle that conflict can factor hugely in the success of the team and in our own happiness.
In this interactive event, our panel will discuss conflict that they have personally faced and how they handled it (even if not always perfectly or even well).</description>

      <description>Lately the term serverless is everywhere, which naturally makes developers skeptical that it is a marketing buzzword. However, behind the term is a useful concept of tools and architecture that takes the need to worry about servers (if not actual servers themselves) out of the equation. In this free online event, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore what serverless is, why it is an important new development, and where it will have the most impact.</description>

      <description>It seems that there are few guarantees in life, but two of them are that the sun will rise in the morning and, with it, will come at least two new JavaScript frameworks. So how is a developer supposed to keep up? How can you tell the contenders from the pretenders? In this free online event, Jen Looper and Holly Schinsky will take a look at some of the more prominent new frameworks to help you decide if they are worth exploring further.</description>
