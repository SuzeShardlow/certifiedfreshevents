Brian LeRoux is the Cofounder/CTO of [begin.com](https://begin.com) which is a new breed of app that helps teams stay organized in Slack. In the process of developing [begin.com](https://begin.com) an entirely serverless cloud functions thing emerged called [arc.codes](https://arc.codes). In a former life Brian worked at Adobe on PhoneGap and its open source upstream Apache Cordova. A longtime fan of the open web he created [wtfjs.com](http://wtfjs.com) and sports a questionable &amp;nbsp; tattoo. Brian believes the future is mobile, seamlessly running in the cloud, on open source software and will be created by hackers like you.
