Shannon is a swiss-army-knife who has worked in all things from project management to product management and basically everything in-between. She is an entrepreneur at heart who loves to dive into the tough questions. This has led her down many paths of conflict, and she hopes this panel will allow her to share a little of what she has learned in her trial-by-fire professional life.
