Jaeriah is a multilingual Software Engineer building product and integrations at Tackle. Coming from a design and entrepreneurial background where she has worked as a couturier, illustrator, graphic designer, and a co-founder of a natural food product company, Jaeriah found herself at an intersection in tech more than 2 years ago where she now applies her passion in building software.

She is also a community leader at Front-end Foxes where she contributes to the school curriculum for people who identify as women to learn front-end technologies. Away from pushing pixels at work, you will find her spending time with her family, learning the violin, engaging with the developer community, adventuring outdoors, and feeding her soul by traveling.
