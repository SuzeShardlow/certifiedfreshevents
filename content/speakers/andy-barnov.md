Looking for a switch from a 15-year long career as an international TV reporter, Andy taught himself programming and got his Ruby/Rails bases covered by graduating from Le Wagon bootcamp in Paris. While pursuing a Computer Science degree in Amsterdam, Andy enjoys teaching beginners to code at various Wagon schools in Europe. 

Rubotnik is his pet project that allows anyone with a minimal programming knowledge to quickly launch a functional (and framework independent) Facebook Messenger bot.
