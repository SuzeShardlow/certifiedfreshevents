Nate has been building on the web for almost a decade. He loves web development because it is the perfect mix of problem solving, helping people, and life-long learning. After freelancing as a web developer to managing a team of developers at an agency, Nate now works at Strattic where he builds serverless, "Jamstacky" integrations for popular WordPress functionality. Fond of saying, “I would be a professional student if it paid the bills,” he has traveled to six continents, lived on four, and speaks Spanish and a smattering of other languages. Outside of work, family, friends, food, coffee, and cooking are his favorite activities.
