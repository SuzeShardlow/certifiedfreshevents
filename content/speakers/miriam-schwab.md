Miriam is the co-Founder and CEO of Strattic, an end-to-end static hosting and publishing platform for WordPress websites. About fourteen years ago, Miriam founded a leading WordPress development company in Israel. After years of dealing with the ongoing struggle of keeping client WordPress sites secure and performant (and not sleeping so soundly at night ðŸ™‚), she realized that these issues could be solved in a radical way and made irrelevant by converting the sites to a static, Jamstack architecture, and founded Strattic.
