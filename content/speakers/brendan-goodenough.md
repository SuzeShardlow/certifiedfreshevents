When I'm not outside going for a nice long walk, hanging out with mates, or chilling in the park listening to podcasts, you'll find me sitting at my desk hammering out some code. Whether it be on personal projects at home, working in a team alongside others at work, or helping out friends with their own projects, I enjoy working through the constant challenges that magically seem to appear when developing awesome new software.
