Sebastian Witalec is a Senior Developer Advocate for Progress who specializes in Angular and NativeScript. He loves working on both serious and fun projects and one day he will use his robot army to conquer the world.

He is always happy to learn about the new stuff and to pass the knowledge as far as his voice (or the wire) can take him. Sebastian is based in London actively working with various Dev communities in Europe. When not acting techie he is a massive football fan/player (probably bigger at heart than skills).
