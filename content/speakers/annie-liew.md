Annie graduated from a front-end focused bootcamp in summer 2019 in Toronto. After two years in the industry, she was made front-end engineering lead at the startup where she was the first dev and person hired.

Getting into coding got her out of a very dark place and threw her onto a new life and career trajectory. As a result, she likes helping others break into it as well- she knows what a big difference it can make. She's given other talks with Scrimba, Hashnode, Microsoft, Google Students Club to name a few and while giving talks is never comfortable, she wants to keep pushing herself to get better.
