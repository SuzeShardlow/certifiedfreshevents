We specialize in creating and organizing events around technology, development/programming and IT - both online and in-person. Our goal is to make each of our events:

- Informative
- Fun
- Affordable
- Cutting-edge
- Social

We understand that technology changes fast, and it can be tough to keep up. That's why our events focus in on new and important topics and our speakers bring you multiple angles to help attendees get the full picture. We know that to be successful in the tech workplace, you can't just specialize in one thing. That's why we are constantly searching for new, important and relevant topics.
