We run a variety of free and paid events for the developer community - both online and in-person. Sponsoring is a great opportunity to reach developers.

Whether you want to support our ongoing free online events, our online paid trainings or our in-person events, we'll create a sponsor package that meets your needs. If you'd like to discuss sponsorship opportunities, contact Brian Rinaldi at [brian@certifiedfreshevents.com](mailto:brian@certifiedfreshevents.com).
