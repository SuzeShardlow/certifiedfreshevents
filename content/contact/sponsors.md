We're just getting started, but we're looking for some great supporters sponsors who want to help us create exciting events for the technology industry and developers. We run free online events for developers every month, paid online training events periodically, and plan to expand to in-person events in 2020.

Whether you want to support our ongoing free online events, our online paid trainings or our in-person events, we'll create a sponsor package that meets your needs. If you'd like to discuss sponsorship opportunities, contact Brian Rinaldi at [brian@certifiedfreshevents.com](mailto:brian@certifiedfreshevents.com).
