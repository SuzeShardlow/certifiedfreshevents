We're just getting started, but we're looking for some great supporters sponsors who want to help us create exciting events for the technology industry and developers. We run free online events for developers every month and plan to expand to in-person events in 2018.

Get in early and be a part of building something new and exciting (while benefiting from our early bird rates)! All of our packages can be [purchased via Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/certifiedfreshevents). There is no minimum time commitment and your support can be cancelled at any time.

You're support will help us keep creating these events and keep them free for the community. You'll be included in the thanks during the introduction of each event. You'll also receive a one-time thank you tweet from @remotesynth and @fresheventsfl on Twitter.

Supporters will also receive special discounted rates to any paid in-person and online events run by Certified Fresh Events provided they maintain their supporter status at the time of registration.
