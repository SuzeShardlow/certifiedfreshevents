Starting in May 2021 Google will incorporate web performance in the ranking of search results based on a set of metrics called Core Web Vitals. Measuring and optimizing Core Web Vitals presents new challenges to those used to traditional web performance measurements like Lighthouse and Web Page Test.

In this talk, we’ll cover each of the metrics in Core Web Vitals, how to best find out your Core Web Vitals score, and common techniques and gotches when optimizing Core Web Vitals. We’ll especially focus on sites using modern frameworks like React/Next.js, Angular, and Vue/Nuxt.js.
