There are more videos on the web than ever, and viewers are becoming more demanding. Yet, video streaming hasn't gotten easier. Most of the legacy solutions we have relied on arenâ€™t really up to the task. MP4 videos don't adapt to your viewers' varying bandwidth environments. In a slow bandwidth environment, viewers face the frustration of videos stalling. In a fast environment, that same MP4 file often doesn't have a high enough resolution. If your website uses YouTube, it's difficult to control the autoplay, competitor ads, and other native settings that intrude on your viewers' experience.

In this talk, we will give you a demo and show you how imgix's [Video API](https://imgix.com/solutions/video-api) and the [video SDK](https://imgix.github.io/ix-video/overview/#quick-start-guides) help you deliver buffer-free videos while controlling the full viewing experience.
