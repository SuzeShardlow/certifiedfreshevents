Progressive Web Apps (or commonly abbreviated to PWAs) are revolutionizing the web by providing flexibility and tools to developers which allow them to bring features such as offline browsing and mobile native-like experience to end-users.

During the workshop, we’ll take a learn and build a PWA focussing on some of its core features and fundamental components such as the Service Worker. We’ll also investigate how an open-source JavaScript library (Wokbox.js) can be used to create compelling PWA experiences. Throughout this workshop we’ll take a look at how modern Web APIs can be leveraged to further enhance the browsing experience.
