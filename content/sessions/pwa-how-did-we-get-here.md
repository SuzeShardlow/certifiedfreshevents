Back in the mid 90's we only had one cross platform choice for building internet connected applications and that was HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So why is it now that after 25+ years have passed we are back to building internet connected applications with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and calling them Progressive Web Apps? Join me as we journey from the webs earliest beginnings to get back exactly where we started, or have we?

Along the way we'll visit old friends like Flash who was to many the first way to add interactivity to web pages. Discuss the introduction of AJAX where the web started to catch up. Shudder at the seismic shift after the introduction of the iPhone and mobile apps only to be challenged by cross platform mobile development platforms like Apache Cordova. Now, we are back to building plain old web apps and what have we learned along the way and what might be coming next?
