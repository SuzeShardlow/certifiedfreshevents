We're just getting started, but we're looking for some great sponsors who want to help us create exciting events for the technology industry and developers. We run free online events for developers every month and plan to expand to in-person events in 2018.

Get in early and be a part of building something new and exciting (while benefiting from our early bird rates)! [**Check out our prospectus!**](/docs/prospectus.pdf)

We'll create a sponsor package that meets your needs, whether that is for an individual event or a group of events. If you'd like to discuss sponsorship opportunities, contact Brian Rinaldi at [brian@certifiedfreshevents.com](mailto:brian@certifiedfreshevents.com).
