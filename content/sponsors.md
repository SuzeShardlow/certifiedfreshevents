We're just getting started, but we're looking for some great sponsors who want to help us create great events for the technology industry and developers. We plan to offer both free online events, paid online events and paid in person events. We'll create a sponsor package that meets your needs, whether that is for an individual event or a group of events.

If you'd like to discuss sponsorship opportunities, contact Brian Rinaldi at [brian@certifiedfreshevents.com](mailto:brian@certifiedfreshevents.com).
