Whatever your role, understanding the fundamentals is critical - whether you are a basketball player or a JavaScript developer.

KnowJS offers a full day of learning and training focused on JavaScript language fundamentals. Whether you are use React, Angular, some other framework or no framework at all, a clear understanding of the fundamentals of the JavaScript language will make you a better developer.

We feature four, hands-on sessions from some of the top developers and trainers in the industry:

* [Promises, Generators, Async - Kyle Simpson](#promises-generators-async)
* [JavaScript Fundamentals for Functional Programming - Bianca Gandolfo](#javascript-fundamentals-for-functional-programming)
* [Computer Science in Front End Dev - Brian Holt](#computer-science-in-front-end-dev-it-s-for-more-than-just-interviews)
* [How to Open Source Your Stuff - Kent C. Dodds](#how-to-open-source-your-stuff)

## Promises, Generators, Async

You probably know about promises by now, but are you still writing your async code as long chains of `.then()`s? DId you leap for joy at the recent `.finally()` promise feature? Bah. That's all anti-pattern if you ask me. Promises are one of the most powerful concepts to be added to JS, but have one of the worst API designs of any JS feature.

So how can we make use of promises but not have to suffer this poor and confusing API? Async functions, of course! Except, async/await has some painful drawbacks. Maybe what we really want is generators.

## JavaScript Fundamentals for Functional Programming

This is a 2hr version of the popular JS Fundamentals for Functional Programming workshop. We will speed through the trickier JS fundamentals that you need to know in order to get started with improving your code style with functional programming techniques.

This is an interactive online workshop with exercises that build upon one another so it isn’t recommended to passively watch webinar style.

**Who is this for?**

* You want to strengthen your JavaScript fundamentals while learning a bit about functional programming.
* You find closures tricky and want to master them once and for all.
*You’ve tried diving into functional programming libraries or workshop and have felt it was a bit over your head.
* You use functional methods or you’ve seen them and you want understand how they work.
* There are lots of cool kids in the functional programming club, and I want to be a cool kid too!

## Computer Science in Front End Dev: It's For More than Just Interviews

A common refrain of many disillusioned front end developers is that deeper computer science concepts are useful mostly for interviews and little else. And to some extent, that can be true! However many are underestimating how often the concepts, the tradeoffs, and other associated concepts subtly arise in every day front end development.

During our time together I will present a few computer science concepts like bloom filters, tree traversals, and array sorting explain how these can show up in places you wouldn't necessarily expect them and how you can leverage these powerful algorithms and data structures to make yourself a better programmer. By the end I hope to show you that these concepts are both worthy of your attention and not so difficult to learn.

## How to Open Source Your Stuff

Building things so they work well in isolation, then piece them together to make the full application makes building applications easier. One thing that really helps with this kind of strategy is to open source your stuff.

In this workshop, we'll take a look at an existing application, identify a good candidate component for open sourcing, and then go through the process of creating an open source project for that component and add it as a project dependency. By the end that component of the application will be easier to work on and contribute to and we'll also have it open for the rest of the world to contribute and improve the software which once had bugs that were just as private as the original project repository.
