We used to call them "static sites," but nowadays they are anything but static. New tools, services and serverless functions are redefining the way we build "static sites" to the point that they needed a new name that represented their real capabilities: JAMStack.

In this session, Raymond Camden of Auth0 and Phil Hawksworth of Netlify will show how to get started with the JAMStack and how you can take advantage of all of these tools to build sites that are dynamic, secure and incredibly fast.

## Why JAMstack? Beyond static sites.

We used to call them static sites, so why can't we just leave that name alone? The JAMstack can actually go a lot further than delivering static sites. You can use it to deliver highly performant, secure, scalable... dynamic web sites. In this talk we'll look at what the JAMstack is, and how we can use emerging tools and conventions to embrace the possibilities of modern web development without exposing ourselves to undue risk.

## Bringing Dynamic Back to Static

Now that you've decided to go static, you may find yourself in a odd position. While 95% of your site may work just fine static, there will often be a few parts that need some kind of dynamic aspect to them. From something as simple as a form to more complex data access, I'll discuss ways to add a bit of dynamic back into a static site.
