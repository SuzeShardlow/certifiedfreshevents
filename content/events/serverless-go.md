Soon after you decide to embrace serverless architectures you realize that there is a need to coordinate all of the components that make up these distributed applications and services. In this course you will stitch together a series of Lambda functions written in the Go programming language (golang) to build and orchestrate a fully-functional and scalable serverless application while learning how to handle the deployment, logging, metric collection, and distributed tracing that help you effectively adopt the serverless way. In addition to picking up some Go, you will learn how to use technologies like AWS SAM CLI, API Gateway, CloudFormation, SQS, DynamoDB, X-Ray, and Step Functions to build, deploy, debug and manage your serverless applications.
