Developers today have the blessing and the curse of a plethora of tools. On the one hand, we have pretty much all of our bases covered - often for free. On the other, it can be tough to keep pace with all the tools and what they are good for.

In this month's meetup, we'll explore a couple of these tools and get to know them. First, Chris Coyier will go through [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and how to take advantage of this social development environment for front-end designers and developers. Then Shannon Soper will explore [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a blazing-fast static site generator for React.

## An Introduction to Using CodePen

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is an online code editor for front end code. Let's dig into how you use and get into some trickery you might not know about even if you're a seasoned CodePen user.

## What makes Gatsby sites so fast?

Learn what makes [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) sites so fast and hear from other developers why they like building with Gatsby and how it improves performance for their site. Then, watch how to you can start building a highly performant site in just a few minutes and preview upcoming projects to improve Gatsby. Finally, learn how to contribute to Gatsby as an open source project.
