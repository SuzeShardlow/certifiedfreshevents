There's been a ton of buzz in the .NET community lately around Blazor. Unlike many hyped technologies however, Blazor seems to have earned the attention. It earned it in part by delivering a solution that gives C# developers what they want but doing so in a way that relied on open web standards. In this session, Microsoft's Jeremy Likness will go deeper into what Blazor is, how it works and how you can use it to build web apps.

## Blazor: Silverlight Done Right

Over a decade ago, the first version of Silverlight was released and rapidly became a panacea for C# developers to write client web apps. The combination of plug-in free smartphones and evolving HTML5 standards led to its fast demise. From its ashes a new framework has been born that accomplishes what it could not: running .NET, in every modern desktop and phone browser, without plug-ins. Learn about Blazor, a framework for building Single Page Applications (SPA) that uses the power of WebAssembly to bring .NET apps to your browser.
