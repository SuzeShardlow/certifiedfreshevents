The way people interact with devices and the internet is changing quickly. We're no longer just clicking on a desktop browser or tapping on a phone screen. We're chatting with bots using text or voice. Or we're interacting with all sorts of internet connected devices that, in many cases don't even have a screen. In this free online meetup, Tomomi Imura of Slack and David Simmons of InfluxData will discuss some these important topics around chat bots, IoT and artificial intelligence.

## Let's Get Chatty with Conversational Interface in JavaScript!

Let’s build rich applications with the natural user interactions with a minimal visual interface with JavaScript with helps with natural language processing APIs! This can be Slack bots, Facebook messenger bots, or even voice-assisted browser bot using W3C web standards!

## Pushing IoT Data Analytics to the Edge

As IoT deployments move forward, the need to collect, analyze, and respond to data further her out on the edge becomes a critical factor in the success -- or failure -- of any IoT project. With most data platforms, it simply isn’t practical, or even possible, to push collection AND analytics to the edge. In this talk I’ll show how I’ve done exactly this with a combination of open source hardware -- Pine64 -- and open source software -- InfluxDB -- to build a practical, efficient and scalable data collection and analysis gateway device for IoT deployments.
