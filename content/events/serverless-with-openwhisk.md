In this free, hands-on workshop, Upkar Lidder of [IBM Developer](https://developer.ibm.com/) will walk you through building three serverless applications using the open source Apache OpenWhisk platform.

## Get Started with Serverless Using OpenWhisk - Hands On Workshop

Joins us for a hands on workshop where we create not one, not two but three simple serverless applications.

**Lab1**: Create, build, and run a cloud-native Java serverless app in less than 15 minutes

**Lab2**: Create, build, and run a cloud-native Java serverless application that uses the Visual Recognition service to determine image content

**Lab3**: Create, build, and run three serverless functions as a sequence
 
We will use Apache OpenWhisk to run through the labs. Openwhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless platform that executes functions (fx) in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk manages the infrastructure, servers and scaling using Docker containers so you can focus on building amazing and efficient applications.

Key concepts introduced will include triggers, rules, actions, composition and event driven architecture. Finally, serverless is relatively new and we will look at what the shortcomings are with the current technology and how to mitigate them.
