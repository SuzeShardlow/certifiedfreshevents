Developers have never had more tools at their disposal, but has this explosion of tools also made web development difficult? Have we erected new barriers to entry for anyone looking to break into a career in web development?

In this free online meetup, Jory Burson will explore the question of when and how web development became so complicated by looking at the evolution of the industry. Then Raymond Camden will explore some of the tools out there designed to help developers learn new skills and highlight some of the pros and cons of each.

## Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?

Learning web development from scratch can be a daunting task. In addition to programming languages, there are all kinds of tools it seems you need to master just to get started: bundlers, taskrunners, package managers, transpilersâ€¦ when and how did web development get to be so complicated? In this talk, we'll follow the evolution of a web page through time, introducing it to technical obstacles and innovations until we arrive at present day. We'll come away with a better appreciation for the problems our modern tools solve, and historical context for how the field has evolved.
