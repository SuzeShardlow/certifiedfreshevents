Over the past few years Go has developed a strong and growing following. IEEE lists it both as one of the top 10 programming languages in 2018, but also as one of its top 5 trending languages. In this session, we'll get to know the Go language better by exploring how to us it to do things like build serverless applications and connect to complex data.

## Orchestrating Serverless Go Applications on AWS

Soon after you decide to embrace serverless architectures you realize the need to coordinate all of the components of your distributed apps and services. In this talk we’ll stitch together a series of Lambda functions written in the Go programming language (golang) to build a serverless Slack command while demonstrating the deployment, logging, metric collection, and distributed tracing that help you effectively adopt the serverless way. You’ll not only pick up some Go, you’ll also see tools like AWS SAM CLI, API Gateway, and Step Functions in action.

## Building a SQL Helper Library in Go

Go has an SQL package as part of its standard library. There are also a few  ORM-like and SQL helper libraries that wrap the standard SQL package. In this talk, Ayan will demonstrate how easy it is to implement something similar yourself and demonstrate the power of Go's type system and richness of Go's standard library.
