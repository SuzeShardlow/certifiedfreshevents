Progressive web apps (PWA) allow for your web apps to have some of the capabilities of mobile apps - like offline availability or the ability to install the app. They have been gaining steam, especially since support on Safari has been improving. In this free online session, Lee Warrick will offer an introduction to PWAs and show you what you need to know to start building one.

## Demystifying PWAs

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, “We need a website, an iOS, *and* an android app! But… we don’t have that many developers…” It’s tough knowing three languages and ecosystems just to get your app in front of all your users. What if there was a better way? Progressive Web Apps could be the solution to your app woes. PWAs are cross-platform, searchable, opt-in apps that can provide native-like experiences using web technology (JS, React, Vue, etc). This talk is going to not only explain what a PWA is, but when you should make one and how to do so easily with your existing skills!
