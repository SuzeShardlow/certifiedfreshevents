Knowing how to code is only one piece of being a successful developer. The other parts involve a desire to learn, an ability to communicate and work with those around you, and even, sometimes, the willingness to accept and learn from failure.

In this free event, Alyssa Nicoll of Progress and Jenell Pizarro of Skillcrush will explore how to develop some of these developer skillsets beyond coding and offer advice that will help you succeed in your career.

## Innovating is not about technology, but psychology.

"It is the recognition that well-read is not a destination, there is nowhere to get to and if there was somewhere to get to, you would need a thousand years to even think about getting there." -Linda Holmes

Many people strive to be “well-read” as developers or designers, they want to know & do it all. But why? All in the name of being “well-read”? All just to say “Yeah — I've done that”?

Why do we do what we do? Why do we try so hard? Why are we here, paying to be here, to listen to people talk? Maybe because we’re life long learners - we want to learn new things? Commune with our own kind? But why? Come examine our motives as developers, the pitfalls we fall into, and the cost of being great.

## Better with Failure

Remember the last time you missed a deadline at work or forgot something programmatically important to you at the time. How did you react? Our answers to failure as well as success can incrementally increase our intelligence regardless of skill. Find out why intelligence isn’t a boolean value but a direct effect of mindset.
