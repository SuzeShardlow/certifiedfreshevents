Sometimes the best way to learn is to tackle a fun challenge, try something a bit out of the ordinary, or take a fresh perspective to an old problem. Our speakers have done just that, from building robots to deep-diving virtual reality. These sessions are a great way to generate new ideas for your next&nbsp;project.
